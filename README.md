Dec 27th - Bullets can be fired from the tanks, but still no interaction with the terrain.<br>
Dec 28th - Changed the way terrain works, so they will be objects that can be interacted with. <br>
Dec 29th - Poor interactions betweeen terrain and bullets.<br>
Dec 30th - Triangles to show angles.<br>

Jan 8th - Terrain is drawn differently, so the game should run slightly more smoothly. <br>
Jan 9th - More minor changes to make the code run more smoothly.<br>
